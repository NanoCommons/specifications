Specifications
==============

Specifications in this repository are written up within or in collaboration
with the NanoCommons project to describe how something could be done. In fact,
if enough people do it that way, the specification becomes a standard.

All specifications in this repository are licensed openly, allowing anyone
to implement this specification, but also to share the specification alongside.
While the license would typically allow you to make modifications, it is
kindly requested to do this in a communal manner, as to not disrupt the
standardization process. Hence, we speak of Open Specifications.

* [Ontology IRIs for the OECD nanomaterials](https://nanocommons.github.io/specifications/oecd/)

This project was taken over from eNanoMapper at the start of NanoCommons.

Repository Structure
====================

Each specification is written up using the same approach as World Wide
Web specifications, with various documentation states (editor's note, working
draft, proposed recommendation, and recommendation), have release dates,
authors, etc. Importantly, there is also a practical "short code" which
you will, for example, see in the URL.

In this source code repository, this short code is also used as folder
name and in tags. That is, each release is tagged in the repository,
for example, as WD-datadesc-20120816. The 'WD' refers to the state
(working draft) and is followed by this short code ('datadesc' in the
example) and the date of release.

Requirements
============

It uses RefSpec.js and a customized version of the matching CSS
([license](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231))
from http://www.w3.org/TR/respec-js/.
