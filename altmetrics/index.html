    <h4>Intended audience</h4>
    <p>
      This document is aimed at database maintainers.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="abstract">
    <p>In an era where accountability is central to science, counting reuse of scientific output must be done carefully.
    Where scientific output was restricted to articles and books in the past, now the situation is much more complex.
    More prominent nowadays is scientific output collected in databases, and focus is given to being able to cite
    data, in addition to conference abstracts and posters earlier.<p>
    <p>This specification is about exposing what published literature is being references in databases. In particular,
    it details how a database can report how much data is extracted from a paricular paper, and outlines how this
    information can be retrieved.</p>
  </section>
  <section class='informative'>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altmetrics">Altmetrics</a> is a term generally used to refer to metrics that count the amount of impact of
      research output. For publications it can count the number of times people have bookmarked it at services
      like Mendeley, Zotero, and CiteULike, but it can also measure the number of pages views the publication
      has received.
    </p>
    <p>
      This specification defines another altmetric: the amount of data from this paper that is found in databases.
      To expose such data, this specification defined a application programming interface (API) to query for such data.
      This idea leverages from the work by Andra Waagmeester on <a href="http://citedin.org/">CitedIn</a> [[Willighagen2013]],
      which uses this approach, but does not formalize an API.
    </p>
    <p>
      The API is composed of two parts: one is the query interface that defines how the database can be queried; the
      second part is the format of the answer returned by the database. The implementation of the API can be done
      in various methods: first, there is a REST-like approach; the second is via a SPARQL end point.
    </p>    
  </section>
  <section class='normative'>
    <h2>REST-like API</h2>
    <p>
      Databases implementing this specification must provide an API that uses crafted URIs to specify the queries.
    </p>
    <h3>Queries</h3>
    <h4>Data by DOI</h4>
    <p>
      This query asks for all entries that cite a particular reference identified by its DOI:
    </p>
    <pre>
      http://example.org/entries/byDOI/$doi
    </pre>
    <h3>Return format</h3>
    <p>
      The query results are provided as RDF as N-TRIPLES using the CiTO predicate <code>cito:citesAsDataSource</code>.
      For example:
    </p>
    <pre class="N-TRIPLES">
      &lt;http://example.org/entry/substance28490> &lt;http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsDataSource> &lt;http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1157784> .
    </pre>
  </section>
  <section class='normative'>
    <h2>SPARQL API</h2>
    <p>
      Databases implementing this query type must provide an API that uses crafted URIs to specify the queries.
    </p>
    <h3>Queries</h3>
    <h4>Data by DOI</h4>
    <p>
      This query asks for all entries that cite a particular reference identified by its DOI:
    </p>
    <pre class="SPARQL">
      SELECT * WHERE {
        ?entry &lt;http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsDataSource> &lt;$doi> .
        OPTIONAL { ?entry a ?type . }
      }
    </pre>
    <h3>Return format</h3>
    <p>
      Any format specified by the SPARQL specification is allowed.
